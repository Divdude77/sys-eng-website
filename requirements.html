                    In collaboration with OWidgets, we organized a series of meetings to clarify project requirements and ensure alignment with their objectives. Establishing weekly meetings allowed for regular updates and continuous feedback, facilitating efficient progress tracking. These discussions helped us in developing our comprehensive MoSCoW list outlining the project's priorities. This systematic approach ensures that tasks are prioritized effectively, laying a solid foundation for successful project execution.<br><br>

                    Our project aims to develop a data synthesis system that leverages the customisability of scent combination offered by OWidget's proprietary olfactometer and the versatility of Bosch's BME680 metal oxide sensor for environment monitoring, to offer a standardised and automised data synthesis process that is suited for the analysis for any compound present in the environment.
                    <br><br>
                    The collected data will be stored in a scent database to facilitate further analysis for quality control and research purposes.
                    <br><br>
                    We aim to offer a machine learning algorithm which can be trained for classification tasks involving any combination of scents from their features in the scent database, which is lightweight and can be deployed on less capable devices. The algorithm approximates the necessary size of the network depending on the number of input features, aiming to balance model size and accuracy.
                    <br><br>
                    All functionalities will be able to be accessed from a webpage UI, which allows remote access to the system, while equally maintaining ease-of-use and customisability by offering both one-click options and advanced configurations depending on the user's needs.
