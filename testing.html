                    Our project was largely research-based, and thus the major parts of our code could not be tested with unit testing. This includes all our code in creating, training and using machine learning (ML) models for scent identification, as well as code involving responses from the hardware (i.e. the olfactometer and sensor).<br><br>

                    For the ML part of our project, we manually tested each of our models until we got a fairly accurate one. For each model we built, we compared the input data, which contained the IDs of the scent in each emission, with the output of our model, to see if there was any large discrepancy in the classification results. We also regularly updated our client, discussing the results to see if the error was potentially a result of our model-building code, or a poor dataset. To resolve these issues, we tested various heater profiles, changing the heater temperature and heating duration, to find a profile which would give us the best dataset for training a model. Since our final model was not 100% accurate, small discrepancies in the model's classification and the actual scent used for the input data for any identification run would be expected.<br><br>

                    To test the hardware, we manually tested the software, observing if the functionalities resulted in the correct response from the olfactometer and sensor. In the case of the olfactometer, we would observe if the scent emission occurred at the correct time, for the correct duration, and using the correct channel. For the sensor, we printed out the readings on the terminal to check if they were being read at the correct intervals, and whether the readings were within the expected range. When the responses differed from what we expected, we would then look through the code to find the error and debug it. <br><br>
