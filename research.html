                    Our client has requested that we use a single BME680 MOX gas sensor, a particularly popular kind of sensor known for versitility and low cost. It is primarily used for detection of volatile organic compounds by heating a metal plate to the desired temperature, where it causes different reaction to gasses in the form of change in resistance. 
                    <br>Typical use cases include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Determining quality of food stuff</li>
                        <li>Monitoring air quality</li>
                        <li>Breath analysis for medical conditions</li>
                    </ol>
                    With this constraint, we first investigated the feasibility of the scent classification task by listing  known issues and currently available systems and use cases. The section below summarises our findings.<br>

                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Poor Selectivity</span><br>
                    MOX sensors are highly sensitive but have poor selectivity. As a result, discriminating among several chemicals, or between targets and backgrounds, becomes difficult. [1]
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Instability, Drift, and Variability between Sensors</span><br>
                    Typically, using a single sensor for detection is generally avoided, as they have the tendency to drift over time, leading to inaccurate readings and need for frequent recalibration. Our observations confirms this, as in the same setup and experiment configuration and lead to wildly different results on different days. Most setups involve an array of sensors [2]. As a result, classification tasks are typically only limited to binary or few classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Burnouts</span><br>
                    The sensor can also be prone to burnouts when too high of a temperature is sustained for extended periods of time, or when there is insufficient cooldown time between measurement cycles. For our preliminary experiments, 3 sensors were burn out even when operating between the recommended temperatures of the manufacturer, likely due to long experiment runs with minimal cooldown in between, yielding abnormally high levels of resistance in stale air. However, as the sensor requires a stabilisation period, cooling down for too long will also lead to inaccurate readings. One of our major challenges is to find through trial and error a suitable measurement frequency which yields sufficient cooldown time to protect the sensor without sacrificing the temporal resolution necessary for classification tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Hotplate Temperature</span><br>
                    Classification performance are also known to be effected by the configuration of heater temperature and frequency, modulated by a balance of gas adsorption and reaction on the surface of the hotplate. If the frequency of the heater voltage is too high, the surface temperature of the sensor could not keep up with the variation of the heater voltage. However, if the frequency is too low, the sensor changes slowly and tends to reach its equilibrium response, similar to a constant temperature mode. In this case, the nonlinear features of sensors could not be extracted and the feature dimension extracted at this constant temperature mode is unstable [3].

                    <ul>
                        <li>Resistance readings are low when the sensor is inactive for more than an hour, hence requires some stabilisation time before every use to reach the reliably readings. The sensor can even miss a few readings when the hotplate fails to reach to desired temperature within the given duration during measurement cycles.</li>
                        <li>The sensor can begin to drift up in resistance readings if it has undergone extensive periods of measurement at high temperatures without cooldown. This burnout is irreversible, where the sensor will continue to have unreliable readings even weeks after and become insensitive to gas exposure.</li>
                        <li>
                            The setup required balancing the initial stabilisation time necessary to get accurate readings and the cooldown period, necessary to prevent sensor burn out through continuous data collection.
                            <ul>
                                <li>We observed that after hours of sensor inactivity, 30 minutes of stabilisation is required, with 100 seconds of stabilisation before every measurement cycle and 10 seconds cooldown between measurements.</li>
                                <li>100 seconds stabilisation time is the shortest optimal time that allows us to have enough accurate readings before the scent emission to establish the baseline for correction later.</li>

                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Linear Increase in Temperature</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using a linear increase in temperature for heater profile (220-400 with 20C steps) and a constant heater duration, we observe the magnitude (percentage decrease) from baseline resistance when the sensor is exposed to the gas, and the reaction (time at lowest resistance) differs from scent to scent.</li>
                        <li>It showed that while the sensor had fairly reproducible responses to some scents, it was less so for the others, The swiftness and magnitude of the reaction to the scents varied greatly from session to session, as shown by left image below. This is a fairly well established problem with single sensors, hence most existing setups for classifying gasses utilize an array of 3 - 24 sensors.</li>
                        <li>It is known that longer heater durations for each temperature is beneficial for scent discrimination. However, we observed the opposite, with the KNN performance decreasing as the heater duration increases. We also lose temporal resolution when using longer heater durations. Image below shows classification reports for 40ms (top middle) and 320ms (top right)</li>
                        <li>The reaction to scent 2 (bottom leftmost) was reproducible across sessions with consistent magnitude and swiftness in response. This is less true for scent 1 (bottom, center left), which has great variability across sessions. It can also be seen that the two attributes (bottom, center right) do not separate the scents very well, with the exception of scent 2 and 3. Running a KNN, it achieves 73% accuracy across sessions but with increased confusion around scent 1.</li>

                        <li>We also failed to observe any meaningful pattern in frequency when applying Fast Fourier Transform to the signal, as there is some variability across sessions.</li>
                        <li>It became obvious that the classification will not be effective using linear increase in temperature for heater profile.</li>

                    <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Default Heater Profile</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As linear increase in heater temperature yielded no promise, we used the default heater profiles in a variant of the sensor we use, BME688, which has multiple lab tested heater profiles for different applications. Our sensor differs with the 688 in that they have an array of 8 sensors, with a maximum of 4 heater profile configurations allowed for each measurement cycle, while we have exactly 1 sensor and a heater profile.</li>
                        <li>We experiment with the default heater profile recommended by Bosch for general use cases, seen in figure 5.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>With the new heater profile, we hoped to observe more distinctive reaction patterns between different scents. The raw resistance readings were not immediately distinguishable between scents (figure 6).</li>
                        <li>However, when using the last few measurement cycles of the stabilisation period as baseline to apply correction, it can be seen that scent 2 - 4 has a fairly distinguishable sensor reaction (figure 7).</li>
                        <li>Scent 1 still suffers from the lack of reaction when compared to scent 0 (air), which means it received little to no reaction during emission.</li>
                        <li>This is particularly intriguing, as scent 1 is peppermint, which is the most pungent scent of our testing group.</li>

However, upon visualisation of the features, it can be seen that the scent are not very distinguishable.</li>
                        <li>With the KNN performing only marginally better than linear increase heater profile, we decided to separate the task into two phases, first establishing a robust classification algorithm in a more restricted environment, then transfer that to an open environment.</li>

                        <li>We move the data collection system in a large plastic container to see if the scents are not distinguishable, or if the concentration in an opened environment is insufficient for a single sensor to classify in open air. </li>
                        <li>However, this setup introduces the issue of container contamination, as 50 regular emissions of 10 seconds for every scent may affect the reading we receive.</li>
                        <li>We attempt to minimize this issue by leaving the container to dissipate the scent for 1.5 hours between scents.</li>
                        <li>The baseline corrected results indicate that the container causes the scents to be vastly more distinguishable, even for previously dormant scent 1.</li>
                        <li>It can be seen that the magnitude and swiftness of resistance decrease, and the rate of recovery in resistance greatly varies between scents.</li>
                        <li>However, we also observe that the magnitude of response decreases as more samples are collected. We suspect this is due to insufficient time between scent emissions for dissipation. </li>
                        <li>When using the same features as we did before, the scents are now much more distinguishable when visualized. </li>

                        <li>Hence, we repeated the experiment again but reversed the order to collect scent 0, then 4 to 1. We observe that the noise that not seen in the previous experiment become more prominent in scent 1 and 2, thus it is reasonable to say that the data collection can be heavily affected if there is contamination.</li>

                        <li>Each window takes approximately 1.5s for features extraction, hence makes it feasible for real time prediction of the scent.</li>

                        <li>Initially, we had decided to go with the ESP32 as the brains of our system, as it was a lightweight, cheap and versatile microcontroller. It worked perfectly with the olfactometer and sensor, integrating the two.</li>
                        <li>However, we soon realised that the processor on the ESP32 wouldn't be able to simulataneously run all the requirements for our project, so we decided to go with the Raspberry Pi.</li>
                        <li>The Raspberry Pi was chosen due to its superior performance capabilities compared to the ESP32. Given the requirement to host a web server, run machine learning algorithms, and operate the olfactometer and sensor simultaneously, the Raspberry Pi offered the necessary computational power to handle these tasks efficiently.</li>
                        <li>Unlike the ESP32, which required the olfactometer to be connected to a laptop, the Raspberry Pi facilitated standalone operation. This eliminated the need for constant user presence during operation, enhancing convenience and usability.</li>
                        <li>Further, the Raspberry Pi's compatibility with Python was a significant factor in our decision-making process. Python's versatility and extensive libraries allowed for seamless integration of machine learning algorithms with the rest of our project components. This streamlined development and facilitated efficient communication between different parts of the system.</li>
                        <li>The Raspberry Pi also benefits from a robust ecosystem of community support, documentation, and resources. This ensured accessibility to troubleshooting guides, tutorials, and libraries, simplifying development and troubleshooting processes.</li>
                        <li>The Raspberry Pi's scalability made it well-suited for potential future expansions or modifications to our project. Its ability to handle additional sensors, peripherals, or functionalities provided flexibility for future enhancements or iterations of the system.</li>
